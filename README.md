# hypersonic3DSTLCalculator

This is a python calculation tool for basic flow analysis of any STL file in supersonic flow
It assume that the geometry passed has the vehicle alligned with the nose at (0,0,0) in STL coordinates and that
the geometry of the vehicle is considered aerodynamic for the speeds it's travelling at.


At present it is unfnished, one of the outstanding issues is recognising a leading edge feature on a model
